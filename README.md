KindredHearts is an Online Adoption Center. 

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the need for efficient and effective systems that facilitate social good has never been more pressing. Our project focuses on creating a comprehensive 
platform dedicated to the adoption of children, aiming to streamline the process for prospective parents while ensuring a supportive environment for children in need of loving homes.
To achieve this, we have employed a robust technological stack that integrates various frameworks and languages. Our backend is built using ASP.NET, providing a solid foundation for our application, 
while Entity Framework enables seamless data management and interaction with our database. For the artificial intelligence components, we utilized Bot Frameworks to create intelligent
chatbots that assist users by answering frequently asked questions and guiding them through the adoption process.

JavaScript plays a pivotal role in our system, serving as the primary language for both frontend and backend development. It powers our interactive web interface, enhancing user experience with dynamic 
elements and responsive design. Alongside JavaScript, we have utilized HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website.
To ensure our code is robust and free of bugs, we conducted extensive testing throughout the development process. 
This rigorous testing phase was essential to guarantee perfect functionality and a seamless user experience. Additionally, we leveraged GitHub for version control and collaboration, 
allowing us to manage our code effectively and maintain a comprehensive repository of our work.
Throughout this document, we will delve into the specifics of our implementation, discussing the various installations and configurations that were necessary to bring our vision to life.
Our commitment to providing a reliable and efficient platform for child adoption is at the forefront of our development efforts, and we are excited to share our journey with you.
